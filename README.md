# Oncogenic_GI_screening
##Here contains data and scripts to reproduce the analysis and figures in the paper.

The analysis majorly include five parts:

I. Pre-processing sequencing data and tranform it to counts of dual-sgRNAs(Python).

II. Quality evaluation on our plasmid and cell libraries for combinatorial CRISPR screening (R).

III. Analysis on GI screenings in vivo (R).

IV. Analysis on GI screenings in vitro (R).

V. Analysis on combinatorial CROP-seq screenings (Python and R).
